// OOPs Assignment - Tennis Match

// To be solved in dartpad.

// 1. Create a class Player which has the attributes- name (String), score (int) and skill (int).
// 2. Create an abstract class Tournament which has two methods - play and displayScores.
// 3. After that, create a class MatchOne which extends Tournament.
// 4. MatchOne has two attributes- playerOne and playerTwo both of type Player initialized through the constructor.
// 5. Override the required methods in MathcOne. The displayScoresmethod prints the score of playerOne and playerTwo.
// 6. In the play method, playerOneâ€™s skill is added to his existing score. Same thing is repeated for playerTwo.
// 7. During execution, initialize the MatchOne with the required attributes. Call the match function twice and print the scores.


class Player {
  String name;
  int skill;
  int score;

    print(playerTwo.score);
  }

  @override

    playerTwo.score = playerTwo.score + playerTwo.skill;
